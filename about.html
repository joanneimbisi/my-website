<p> Hello, my name is Joanne Imbisi and I was born in Nairobi, Kenya but moved to the US at the age of 4. I attened CSUS from 2014-2017 then applied for the Nursing Program at Sac City College. I knew I made the wrong career choice when I submitted my application and hoped I didn't get in. I was a nursing student for two semsters and finally mustered the courage to switch careers. I had no idea what I wanted to do other than use my creativity and work from home. After doing some research I came across coding. I watched some tutorials and soon realized that this was the right path for me. I am so grateful to embark on this new journey with Flatiron and cannot wait to become a Software Engineer! </p>
